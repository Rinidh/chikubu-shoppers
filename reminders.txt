how to prevent heading from going behind header upon cliking on-pg link
show menu at 425px below (temporarily), don't show at tablet after finish all home page
responsive design edit strategy (after initally designing for desktop):
  -copy cuurent code into tablet's query
  -modify current code for mobile (as best to start mobile first)
  -keep comparing & eliminating unnecessary props from tablet's code
  -copy tablet's code into laptop code (to prevent some laptop props from del) & now edit tablet's code (comparing to mobile & as seen in browser)
  -finally laptop's code
  -first make one component responsive at ALL screen sizes, then next component; instead of making all components responsive at mobile, then all components responsive for laptop
